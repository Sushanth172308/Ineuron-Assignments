Give an example.\n","A:: Prior probability shows the likelihood of an outcome in a given dataset. For example, in the mortgage case, P(Y) is the default rate on a home mortgage, which is 2%. P(Y|X) is called the conditional probability, which provides the probability of an outcome given the evidence, that is, when the value of X is known.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["2. What is posterior probability? Give an example.\n","\n","A: Posterior probability is a revised probability that takes into account new available information. For example, let there be two urns, urn A having 5 black balls and 10 red balls and urn B having 10 black balls and 5 red balls.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["3. What is likelihood probability? Give an example.\n","\n","A: Likelihood Function in Machine Learning and Data Science is the joint probability distribution(jpd) of the dataset given as a function of the parameter. Think of it as the probability of obtaining the observed data given the parameter values.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["4. What is Naïve Bayes classifier? Why is it named so?\n","\n","A:Naive Bayes is a simple and powerful algorithm for predictive modeling. Naive Bayes is called naive because it assumes that each input variable is independent. This is a strong assumption and unrealistic for real data; however, the technique is very effective on a large range of complex problems.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["5. What is optimal Bayes classifier?\n","\n","A:The Bayes Optimal Classifier is a probabilistic model that makes the most probable prediction for a new example. Bayes Optimal Classifier is a probabilistic model that finds the most probable prediction using the training data and space of hypotheses to make a prediction for a new data instance.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["6. Write any two features of Bayesian learning methods.\n","\n","A:: A probability distribution over observed data for each possible hypothesis. New instances can be classified by combining the predictions of multiple hypotheses, weighted by their probabilities.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["7. Define the concept of consistent learners.\n","\n","A: Consistent Learners: A learner L using a hypothesis H and training data D is said to be a consistent learner if it always outputs a hypothesis with zero error on D whenever H contains such a hypothesis. • By definition, a consistent learner must produce a hypothesis in the version space for H given D.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["8. Write any two strengths of Bayes classifier.\n","\n","A:This algorithm works quickly and can save a lot of time. Naive Bayes is suitable for solving multi-class prediction problems. If its assumption of the independence of features holds true, it can perform better than other models and requires much less training data.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["9. Write any two weaknesses of Bayes classifier.\n","\n","A:The greatest weakness of the naïve Bayes classifier is that it relies on an often-faulty assumption of equally important and independent features which results in biased posterior probabilities.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["10. Explain how Naïve Bayes classifier is used for\n","\n","1. Text classification\n","\n","2. Spam filtering\n","\n","3. Market sentiment analysis\n","\n","A:Navie Bayes Classifier is used for:\n","\n","Text classification:\n","The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple classifier that classifies based on probabilities of events. It is the applied commonly to text classification. With the training set, we can train a Naive Bayes classifier which we can use to automaticall categorize a new sentence.\n","\n","Spam filtering:\n","Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam. It is one of the oldest ways of doing spam filtering, with roots in the 1990s.\n","\n","Market sentiment analysis:\n","Market Sentiment analysis is a field dedicated to extracting subjective emotions and feelings from text. One common use of sentiment analysis is to figure out if a text expresses negative or positive feelings. Naive Bayes is a popular algorithm for classifying text."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyNILk8OOB/gakYoYa7gakKR","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.8.13 (conda)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.13"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"83aca62f18954cf13f96418a44a5b107d52f853e6c55d41e444eea0993e5d51e"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
