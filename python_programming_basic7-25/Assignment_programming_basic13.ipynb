    "Following are the fixed values of C and H:\n",
    "C is 50. H is 30.\n",
    "D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated\n",

    "Example\n",
    "Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:\n",
    "100,150,180\n",
    "The output of the program should be:\n",

    "Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The\n",
    "element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.\n",
    "Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,Â¡Y-1.\n",

    "Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the\n",
    "words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.\n",
    "Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:\n",

    "Question 4:\n",
    "Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints\n",
    "the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.\n",
    "Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:\n",
    "hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again\n",
    "Then, the output should be:\n",

    "Question 6:\n",
    "A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to\n",
    "check the validity of password input by users.\n",

    "1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]\n",
    "2. At least 1 number between [0-9]\n",
    "1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]\n",
    "3. At least 1 character from [$#@]\n",
    "4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6\n",
    "5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12\n",
    "Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them\n",
    "according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each\n",
    "separated by a comma.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "If the following passwords are given as input to the program:\n",
    "ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345\n",
